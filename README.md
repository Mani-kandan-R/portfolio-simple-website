# Portfolio Website  

This is a simple portfolio website created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes two pages: **Home** and **Contact**, designed to present personal or professional information and make it easy for visitors to get in touch.  

## Features  
- **Home Page**:  
  - An introduction about myself, highlighting my skills and experience.  
  - A clean and visually appealing layout.  
- **Contact Page**:  
  - A simple form for visitors to reach out.  
  - Additional contact details like email or social media links (if applicable).  

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates my ability to create a basic website structure using HTML and CSS. It's a starting point for building more advanced web projects in the future.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
   ```  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the Home page.  
3. Navigate to the Contact page using the link provided on the Home page.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add more pages, such as an "About" or "Projects" page.  
- Implement a responsive design to optimize the website for all screen sizes.  
- Integrate JavaScript for form validation on the Contact page.
